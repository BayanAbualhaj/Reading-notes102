**Life during quarntine** 
there are a few things you can do while **lockdown** , however its not *easy* to amuse *your-self* meanwhile nothing is available.
Here are some activity I do :

*** Watching movies at [Netflix](http://nitflex.com)

*** Cooking! and the is my favorite [resipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPPcNPdq_j4)

Hope all of you are ***safe and healthy*** 
in this paragraph I used the markdown method to write markdown is a mark language as HTML but its very light it doesn't has any command in it 
1. any thing between ** ** will have a bold font 
2. any thing between * * will have etalic font 
3. anything between *** *** will have bold & etalic font 
4. to do a link attached in markdown we name it in between [] and dirictly follow the link in between ()example:[Netflix](http://nitflex.com)
