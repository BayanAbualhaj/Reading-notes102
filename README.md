# How to own a Growth mindset!
 ***Growth Mindset*** *is* how to be a better persone by developing the fundamental abilities and having fun by learning somthing new.It **depends** on:
 * Talent 
 * Intelligance

***Without growth mind set*** the previous aren't important as it seems.

Once in while I make to *my-self* a small test to remind me to be able of growth mindeset 
- What would I do if I faced the following :
  * challenge ?
    - [ ] Avoid  
    - [ ] Embraces
    
  * Obstacles 
    - [ ] Loses focus 
    - [ ] Persist 
  
  * Effort 
    - [ ] View as fruitless 
    - [ ] No pain No gain
    
  * Criticism 
    - [ ] Ignores 
    - [ ] Learn from it 
    
  * Success of others 
    - [ ] A threat 
    - [ ] An inspiration 
    
 Simple quistion of those with the **wrong** answer as "Avoid, loses focus, view as fruitless, ignores and a threat" tells me **Be careful !**.
 Something has to change I'm not thinking by growth mind set!.
